<h1>Privacy Policy for Personal SMS AI Helper</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 2026</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains how Personal SMS AI Helper (“the Service”) handles information. This is a private, personal-use system operated solely by one individual. No other users have access.</p>

<h2>1. Information Collected</h2>
<p>The Service only processes SMS messages sent by the operator (the sole user), SMS replies generated by the AI, and basic technical logs required for message delivery. No information is collected from third parties.</p>

<h2>2. How Information Is Used</h2>
<p>Information is used only to allow the personal user to interact with their own AI assistant through SMS. No data is analyzed or used for marketing or profiling.</p>

<h2>3. No Data Sharing or Selling</h2>
<p>The Service does not sell or share data with advertisers or any external parties. Data is only processed by Twilio for SMS delivery and OpenAI for generating replies.</p>

<h2>4. Data Storage & Retention</h2>
<p>SMS logs may be temporarily stored as required for message delivery. No long-term storage is intentionally maintained. Logs are automatically deleted according to Twilio/Render defaults.</p>

<h2>5. Opt-Out Instructions</h2>
<p>Replying “STOP” disables automated replies. Replying “START” re-enables them.</p>

<h2>6. Data Security</h2>
<p>Reasonable security measures are in place, including encrypted connections and secure hosting through Render and Twilio.</p>

<h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>The Service is not intended for minors. No information is knowingly collected from children under 18.</p>

<h2>8. Contact</h2>
<p>For privacy concerns or data deletion requests, contact: <strong>[your email]</strong></p>

<h2>9. Changes</h2>
<p>Updates to this Privacy Policy will be posted on this page.</p>
